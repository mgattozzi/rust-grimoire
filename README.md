# The Rust Grimoire: Intermediate Knowledge for Rustaceans

Rust knowledge tends to cover how to use the language, both as an advanced user

synthesizing them in both larger concepts and how they relate to other domains
of knowledge. This book seeks to fill the gap that's not covered by TRPL, the
Nomicon, or other sources of more advanced knowledge.
