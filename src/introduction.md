# Introduction

Rust has changed a lot in the past few years since it's 1.0 release in 2015 with
new features, design patterns, and libraries. Unfortunately what hasn't changed
is the lack of documentation, books, or articles for intermediate users, those
who have finished TRPL up to Ch 10 and have a basic understanding of how Rust is
written, but not how to use it effectively or idiomatically. That's where this
book comes in.

If you've struggled with:

- What Idiomatic Rust looks like
- Rust design patterns
- Building larger non-toy programs
- Not knowing what crates to use
- Understanding lifetimes in a more concrete manner
- Macros
- Generics and Traits and using them effectively
- Error Handling
- Which classical design patterns do and don't apply to Rust
- Data Structures in Rust
- Modeling algorithms in Rust
- Understanding how to do FFI
- Actually using Rust for parallelism and concurrency beyond knowing Send + Sync

then this is the book for you. Even if you are a more advanced user there will
likely be something for you to gain from this or refer back to at some point.
This book is a culmination of years of experience using Rust, both as a hobbyist
and professionally, and interacting with the community at large. I'm writing the
book I wish had existed in 2015 when I first sunk my teeth into Rust. I hope
it'll level up your knowledge in a way where you feel more confident in using
Rust in ways that allow you to contribute to other projects or begin your own
serious project in earnest.
